## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run the payment gateway migration
npm run db:migrate
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 3. Gateway Setup
```bash
# Initialize payment gateways for all tenants
npm run setup-payment-gateways
```

### 4. Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive subscription automation tests
npm run test-subscription-automation
```

## Usage Examples

### Processing a Refund
```typescript
import { paymentService } from './lib/payments/PaymentService';

// Process a full refund
const refundResult = await paymentService.processRefund(
  tenantId,
  paymentId,
  undefined, // full refund
  'customer_request'
);

// Process a partial refund
const partialRefund = await paymentService.processRefund(
  tenantId,
  paymentId,
  25.50, // refund amount
  'unused_time_refund'
);
```

### Subscription Cancellation with Refund
```typescript
import { subscriptionService } from './lib/subscription/SubscriptionService';

const cancellationResult = await subscriptionService.cancelSubscription(
  subscriptionId,
  tenantId,
  {
    refundUnusedTime: true,
    reason: 'customer_request',
    userId: userId
  }
);

console.log(`Refund amount: ${cancellationResult.refundAmount}`);
console.log(`Refund ID: ${cancellationResult.refundId}`);
```

### Gateway Configuration
```typescript
import { paymentService } from './lib/payments/PaymentService';

// Setup Stripe for a tenant
await paymentService.setupGateway(tenantId, 'stripe', {
  displayName: 'Stripe',
  isActive: true,
  priority: 1,
  config: {
    secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
    webhookSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  },
  supportedCurrencies: ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP'],
  supportedCountries: ['US', 'CA', 'GB']
});
```

## Payment Processing Flow

### Subscription Renewal
1. **Cron Job Trigger** - Daily at 1 AM UTC
2. **Renewal Check** - Identify subscriptions due for renewal
3. **Invoice Generation** - Create renewal invoice with proper numbering
4. **Payment Processing** - Use stored payment method via gateway
5. **Success Handling** - Update subscription, mark invoice paid
6. **Failure Handling** - Increment failure count, trigger dunning

### Refund Processing
1. **Refund Request** - Via cancellation or manual trigger
2. **Payment Lookup** - Find original successful payment
3. **Gateway Selection** - Choose appropriate payment gateway
4. **Refund Execution** - Process refund via gateway API
5. **Database Update** - Record refund details and status
6. **Status Tracking** - Monitor refund completion

### Dunning Management
1. **Failed Payment Detection** - Payment failure triggers dunning
2. **Strategy Selection** - Choose dunning strategy (default/gentle/aggressive)
3. **Campaign Scheduling** - Schedule email reminders and actions
4. **Progressive Actions** - Email → Grace → Suspend → Cancel
5. **Status Updates** - Track subscription status changes

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Gateway Health Monitoring
```typescript
// Test gateway configuration
const healthResult = await paymentService.testGateway(tenantId, 'stripe');

if (healthResult.healthy) {
  console.log(`Gateway healthy - ${healthResult.responseTime}ms`);
} else {
  console.log(`Gateway unhealthy - ${healthResult.message}`);
}
```

### Payment Statistics
```typescript
// Get gateway statistics
const stats = await paymentService.getGatewayManager().getGatewayStats(tenantId);
console.log(`Success rate: ${stats[0].successRate}%`);
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Refund Fallbacks
- Gateway failures fall back to manual refund tracking
- Retry mechanisms for temporary failures
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

### Payment Failures
- Configurable retry attempts
- Dunning campaign automation
- Grace period management
- Subscription status progression

### Database Consistency
- Atomic operations for payment processing
- Proper transaction handling
- State change audit trail

## Development and Testing

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Setup payment gateways
npm run setup-payment-gateways
```

### Testing Payment Flows
```bash
# Test complete subscription automation
npm run test-subscription-automation

# Test specific payment scenarios
npm run test-payments
```

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Environment variable storage
- No hardcoded secrets
- Proper key rotation support

### Webhook Security
- Signature verification for all webhooks
- Replay attack prevention
- Proper error handling

### PCI Compliance
- No storage of sensitive payment data
- Proper tokenization via payment gateways
- Secure communication channels

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Payment Gateways
- PayPal integration
- Square payment processing
- Regional payment providers

### Advanced Features
- Multi-currency support expansion
- Advanced fraud detection
- Payment method management UI
- Subscription modification handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Refunds not processing**
- Check gateway configuration and API keys
- Verify payment exists and is in COMPLETED status
- Review gateway-specific error messages

**Renewals failing**
- Ensure payment methods are stored correctly
- Check subscription status and billing dates
- Verify gateway health and connectivity

**Dunning not triggering**
- Check cron job execution
- Verify failed payment detection logic
- Review dunning strategy configuration

### Debug Commands
```typescript
// Check gateway availability
const gateways = await paymentService.getAvailableGateways(tenantId);

// Test gateway connection
const health = await paymentService.testGateway(tenantId, 'stripe');

// Review payment records
const payments = await db.select().from(payments).where(eq(payments.tenantId, tenantId));
```
