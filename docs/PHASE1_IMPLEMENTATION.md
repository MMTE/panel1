**File: `apps/web/src/hooks/useInvoices.ts`**
- Removed demo mode and mock invoice data completely
- Enhanced real tRPC integration with proper caching strategy
- Implemented optimized query performance with staleTime configuration

**File: `apps/web/src/components/admin/CreateInvoiceModal.tsx`** (NEW FILE)
- Created comprehensive invoice creation modal with dynamic line items
- Implemented real-time tax calculations and total computations
- Added client selection integration with live client data
- Built professional form validation with comprehensive error handling
- Integrated with real tRPC mutations for invoice creation

#### **Impact & Results**
- âœ… **Dynamic invoice creation** with unlimited line items

### **Task 1.5: Dashboard Real-Time Integration**

#### **Problem Statement**
The admin dashboard displayed static mock statistics and activity feeds, providing no real business insights or operational data.

#### **Implementation Changes**

**File: `apps/api/src/routers/dashboard.ts`** (NEW FILE)
- Created complete dashboard router with real database queries
- Implemented PostgreSQL aggregations for live business metrics
- Built tenant-aware statistics with proper data isolation
- Added recent activity feeds with proper timestamp formatting

**File: `apps/api/src/routers/index.ts`**
- Added dashboard router to main router configuration
- Ensured proper type safety and integration with existing routes

**File: `apps/web/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`**
- Removed all demo mode logic and mock data
- Enhanced real-time data integration with tRPC queries
- Implemented professional loading states and error boundaries
- Added live business metrics with proper formatting

#### **Impact & Results**
- âœ… **Live business metrics** from PostgreSQL aggregations
- âœ… **Real-time activity feeds** with proper timestamps
- âœ… **Tenant-aware statistics** with proper data isolation
- âœ… **Professional loading states** and error boundaries
