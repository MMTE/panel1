# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security architecture, policies, and best practices for the Panel1 platform. All developers contributing to Panel1 must adhere to these guidelines.

## Core Security Principles

-   **Defense in Depth**: We layer security controls to protect against a variety of threats.
-   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and system components should only have the permissions necessary to perform their functions.
-   **Secure by Default**: The system is designed to be secure out-of-the-box.

## Authentication

-   **Method**: Authentication is handled via **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
-   **Flow**:
    1.  A user submits credentials (email/password).
    2.  The API validates the credentials and generates a signed, short-lived JWT.
    3.  The JWT is sent to the client and stored securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie).
    4.  The JWT is included in the header of all subsequent API requests.
    5.  The `protectedProcedure` in our tRPC setup automatically validates the token on every protected endpoint.
-   **Token Security**: Tokens are signed using a strong secret key (`JWT_SECRET`) and have a short expiration time to minimize the risk of replay attacks.

## Authorization (Role-Based Access Control)

-   **RBAC**: Access to resources and actions is controlled by a robust RBAC system.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Permissions are defined in the database (`permissions` table).
    -   Roles are collections of permissions (`roles` table).
    -   Users are assigned roles (`users` table).
-   **Enforcement**: Permission checks are performed within the relevant API procedures using our `PermissionManager`. Any procedure that modifies data or exposes sensitive information must be protected by a permission check.

```typescript
// Example of a permission check in a tRPC procedure
await ctx.permissionManager.requirePermission('invoices.create');
```

## Data Encryption

-   **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data stored in the database, such as API keys or payment gateway credentials, **must** be encrypted.
-   **Mechanism**: We use an `EncryptionService` that implements **AES-256-GCM**, a highly secure authenticated encryption algorithm.
-   **Usage**: The `EncryptionService.encrypt()` and `EncryptionService.decrypt()` methods should be used to handle all sensitive configuration data. The encryption key is managed as a critical environment secret.

## Input Validation

-   All data received from external sources (i.e., user input via API) **must** be validated.
-   We use **Zod** in our tRPC routers to enforce strict schemas on all incoming data. This prevents a wide range of injection attacks and ensures data integrity.

## Audit Logging

-   **Requirement**: All significant events, especially those with security implications, must be logged.
-   **Events to Log**:
    -   User login (successful and failed).
    -   Password changes and resets.
    -   Creation, modification, or deletion of key resources (e.g., users, invoices, clients, plugins).
    -   Changes to roles and permissions.
-   **Implementation**: The `AuditService` provides a standardized way to record audit events. It captures who did what, and when.

## Secure Development Practices

-   **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities. Use `pnpm audit` to scan for issues.
-   **Secrets Management**: Never hard-code secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.) in the source code. Use environment variables and the `.env` file (which is git-ignored).
-   **Error Handling**: Do not leak sensitive information, such as stack traces, in error messages sent to the client. Our tRPC setup helps manage this by default.

Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory for ensuring the security and integrity of the Panel1 platform.
